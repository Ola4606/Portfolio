This was a project personal to me, and I wanted it to look nice. Before making the website, I developed my skills on CSS Grids and Flexboxes, as I knew I would need them throughout the website _(I used flexboxes all through the website, and I used responsive grids, particularly in the projects section)_ .

I made the website fully unique to me, and I used my brand colors all through. As a web developer, I believe it is important to show my skills through my portfolio _(by building it myself from the ground up)_, and that is exactly what I have done.

Using TailwindCSS breakpoints, I was able to make it fully responsive for mobile, tablet, and laptop screens.

While building this website, I was able to improve my skills on some React principles and concepts, such as:

*   Using React Hooks _(namely useState, and useEffect)_
*   Using React Memo
*   Passing and receiving props
*   Using SVGs in React, etc.

**Key NPM Packages used:**  react-router-dom
