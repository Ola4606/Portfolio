      <div>
        This is a project personal to me, and I wanted it to look nice. Before
        making the website, I developed my skills on CSS Grids and Flexboxes, as
        I knew I would need them throughout the website (I used flexboxes all
        through the website, and I used responsive grids, particularly in the
        projects section). I made the website fully unique to me, and I used my
        brand colors all through. As a web developer, I believe it is important
        to show my skills through my portfolio (by building it myself from the
        ground up), and that is exactly what I have done. Using TailwindCSS
        breakpoints, I was able to make it fully responsive for mobile, tablet,
        and laptop screens. While building this website, I was able to improve
        my skills on some React principles and concepts, such as i) Using React
        Hooks (namely useState, and useEffect), ii) Using React Memo, iii)
        Passing and receiving props, iv) Using SVGs in React, etc.

      <div>
        'World's Richest' was my first React project, and it was built using
        React and TailwindCSS. It consumes live data from this API:
        https://forbes400.herokuapp.com/api/forbes400/real-time which provides
        data on the world's richest individuals in real-time. Although, this
        website only shows data on the top 100 richest people. It allows users
        to view the following data on the world's top 100 richest people: Rank,
        Full Name, Net worth (in US dollars), Source of wealth, Residence, and
        Bio (a brief background). As I said earlier, this was my first React
        project, but I did not want to create the same old e-commerce website or
        weather website that most Junior React developers were making, so I
        created this. While creating this website I wanted to incorporate the
        data available on the Forbes website into an easy-to-use and simple
        website, so people could get the data they needed straight out of the
        website without all the other distractions. Using TailwindCSS
        breakpoints, I was able to make it fully responsive for mobile, tablet,
        and laptop screens. While building this website, I was able to improve

      "CalmSlides is a simple-to-use web product that makes relaxing easier. It exposes users to thousands of randomly picked Unsplash images in a sliding marquee format in a short period. CalmSlides helps users to think, relax, and tune off.",

    fullDescription: (
      <div>
        CalmSlides in basic terms is a marquee-styled slideshow of randomly
        selected images. It is powered by another project of mine called the
        “CalmSlides Bot” (this was a worker bot built with NodeJS, that ran for
        4 days, and stored the metadata of about 100,000 Unsplash images | which
        was all legal according to the Unsplash API guidelines). On the website,
        users can have “Relaxation Sessions” for which they can set the time
        (how long the slideshow will last, e.g., 5mins) and speed (how fast the
        slideshow will move, e.g., Medium). The website uses the image URLs from
        the metadata stored on my MongoDB database to power the relaxation
        sessions, but there were some problems I ran into while building this
        project with MongoDB: Immediate Problem: I am using the MongoDB free
        tier, meaning that there are a limited number of connections allowed at
        a time to the database (about 500 simultaneous connections). So, all
        users could not be connected to the database directly. Solution: I used
        the MongoDB Data API service to act as a medium between the users and
        the MongoDB database. This solves the immediate problem because, all
        users now retrieve data using an API, rather than connecting directly
        with the database; meaning that only 1 connection is being made to the
        database on behalf of all users. Further Problem: MongoDB prevents their
        Data API service from being used directly from the browser
        (client-side), due to some CORS policy violations, which was a problem I
        did not know about until after writing the code to get data using the
        Data API service. Solution: I used the MongoDB Realm service (through
        the realm-web NPM package) which allows users to make the MongoDB Data
        API calls (as a function) from the MongoDB servers and returns the data
        to them on the browser. A Further Further Problem: I am using MongoDB
        Realm on its free tier, hence I am limited to 1 million function calls
        per month, after which users cannot use my website. Solution (Coming
        Soon!): I aim to build an API using ExpressJS that runs the MongoDB API
        calls server side to retrieve the data for the users. I will make
        requests to this API using the Axios NPM package and return the data to
        the browsers. This will allow me to avoid MongoDB Realm. Using
        TailwindCSS breakpoints, I was able to make it fully responsive for
        mobile, tablet, and laptop screens. While building this website, I was
        able to improve my skills on some React principles and concepts, such as
        i) Using React Hooks (namely useState, useEffect, and useMemo), ii)
        Using React Memo, iii) Passing and receiving props, etc. I also learned
        new principles, which included i) The React Router DOM NPM Package which
        allowed me to add multi-page navigation to the website, and ii) The
        Realm-web NPM package which allowed me to use MongoDB Realm services.
        Key NPM Packages used: realm-web, react-timer-hook, react-router-dom

    fullDescription: (
      <div>
        This bot was built using NodeJS, and it simply makes a request to the
        Unsplash API every 2mins (using the node-schedule NPM package) to
        receive data on 30 images. Why I created this bot? I created this bot to
        solve a problem. I needed thousands of Unsplash images each time a user
        wanted to have a “relaxation session” on my other project “CalmSlides”,
        and the Unsplash API (in development mode) restricts the number of
        requests I can make to 50 requests per hour (Note: in each request I can
        retrieve data on up to 30 images maximum). Hence to solve this problem I
        created a bot that made requests for all the image data I could need on
        the website beforehand, and store it on MongoDB, so I would not need to
        make an API call each time I needed the images on “CalmSlides”. The bot
        ran for 4 days, and stored data on 92,813 images, before I shut it down
        (temporarily). It uses the mongoose NPM package to connect to MongoDB
        and store data in the database. During this project, I learned how to
        store data in MongoDB by creating Schemas and Models. Key NPM Packages
        used: node-fetch, mongoose, node-schedule, unsplash-js, dotenv

        I picked up new skills and developed old ones. a) I improved my version

        package. c) Through this project I gained additional knowledge on how to
        store and retrieve data from a local database in Flutter Applications,
        using the hive package. d) Through this project I also continued to
        develop my skills in building exceptionally beautiful Mobile User
